ofxStandardPaths
===

Description
---
ofxStandardPaths is an addon for openframeworks <https://github.com/openframeworks/openframeworks>.
It provides an easy way to access standard paths.

This is still a work in progress. I only needed to access media directories so far. Locations such appData, appLocalData, appConfig still need to be discussed.

Installation
---
```
git clone https://github.com/thomasgeissl/ofxStandardPaths.git /path/to/your/openframeworks/addons/ofxStandardPaths
